Additionally, I believe this is a great opportunity to unleash creative and innovative ideas. I have always had a desire to make the world a better place with new technologies and ideas, and I think this competition is the ideal platform to turn that dream into reality. Through JUNCTION ASIA 2024, I have several goals I wish to achieve. Given the hackathon's nature of completing a project within a limited time, I want to significantly enhance my focus and problem-solving skills. I aim to develop my technical abilities further by encountering the latest technology trends and applying innovative ideas. Furthermore, I hope to build a broad network through collaboration with participants from various backgrounds, sharing and learning from each other's experiences and knowledge. This will greatly benefit my future projects and career. Lastly, I want to implement more advanced ideas based on the experiences I gained last year. JUNCTION ASIA 2024 will provide me with both challenges and growth opportunities. I want to explore new possibilities through this competition and achieve great accomplishments both personally and with my team.'''"
